          <h3>Taunton East Street closure affecting local buses</h3>
          <p>
            A small part of East Street in Taunton's Town Centre will be closed from Monday January 19th until Friday January 23rd.
            This will prevent local buses, including the No.4, No.6, No. 374 and the Park and Ride, from using this route. Instead, buses will be
            diverted via Hurdle Way & Upper High Street.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Dunster (Minehead) roadworks causing delays until April 2026</h3>
          <p>
            The traffic lights along the A39 at Dunster are currently being replaced, which is causing long queues in both direction.
            This is affecting the No. 28 bus which connects Taunton and Minehead.

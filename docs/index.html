          <h3>Taunton East Street closure affecting local buses</h3>
          <p>
            A small part of East Street in Taunton's Town Centre will be closed from Monday January 19th until Friday January 23rd.
            This will prevent local buses, including the No.4, No.6, No.21, No. 374 and the Park and Ride, from using this route. Instead, buses will be
            diverted via Hurdle Way, Billetfield, Mary Street & Upper High Street.
          </p>
          <p>The following stops will be used during the East Street road closure:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stand J for the No.4 service, instead of stand I.</li>
            <li>Stand J for the No.6 service, instead of stand I.</li>
            <li>Stand G (Castleway) for the No.374 service, instead of stand I.</li>
            <li>Stand E (Corporation Street) for the Park and Ride in both directions, instead of stand K.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Dunster (Minehead) roadworks causing delays until April 2026</h3>
          <p>
            The traffic lights along the A39 at Dunster are currently being replaced, which is causing long queues in both directions.
            This is affecting the No. 28 bus service which connects Taunton and Minehead.
